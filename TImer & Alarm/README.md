To use said program you must install the pygame module <br />
To do so on a windows machine : <br />
>win+R <br />
>"cmd" <br />
>Hit run <br />
>Enter the following command: <br />
>py -m pip install -U pygame --user <br />
<br />
An Installed message should appear if not do something find something idk this python module installing buisness is pretty treacherous
